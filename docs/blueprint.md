## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Accent blue (#5596E6) to highlight key elements and calls to action. This color provides a modern, energetic feel without being overwhelming.
- Background color: Dark gray (#2A303C) to provide a professional backdrop. This creates a sleek look and ensures high contrast for readability.
- Accent color: Lighter analogous blue (#7AB3E6), approximately 30 degrees to the 'right' on the color wheel. Significantly different brightness, approximately 45% lightness, ensures a soft but noticeable visual.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern aesthetic. Its neutral and objective look is highly suitable for a portfolio website.
- Use simple, line-based icons for navigation and key features. These should be in a light gray or accent blue for clarity.
- Implement a grid-based layout for a structured, easy-to-navigate experience. Prioritize mobile responsiveness.
- Subtle, engaging animations using Three.js on project display and page transitions. Keep animations professional, to enhance user experience, without being intrusive. This should add visual interest and dynamism.
